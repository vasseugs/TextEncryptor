# TextEncryptor

This is a console program that can encrypt .txt files using your unique ecryption key of any length. 
I wrote the program during my studying process with the intention to make a program that can be useful for me or for
somebody else.

# Who needs this program 

Personnaly, I have a lot of different accounts and, hence, a lot of different logins and passwords for them.
It's impossible to rememeber them all. So I keep them in .txt file on the external hard drive. But what if
somebody finds your passwords? You need to hide them somehow. This is what my Text Encryptor can be useful for.

The program also works not only to encrypt passwords, it can encrypt .txt files with any information. For example, it can be
your secret diary. Encrypt it and nobody will be able to read it without knowing your encryption key.

# How to use

Firstly, you need a .txt file. 
Then, run the program in terminal or your IDE and follow the instructions. 
When it's time to enter the encrypion key, you can use a combination of Unicode characters of ANY length.
The longer the key, the more strong it will be. 
The only problem is that you need to remebmer encryption key or keep it somewhere. 
At the end the program will create a .txt file with encrypted information.

When you will need to decrypt your file, run the program and choose decrypting option.
You will be asked to ender the same key you used during the encryption of the file. The wrong
key will lead to the whole mess in decrypted file, so only the same encryption key will work - this
principle will protect you from somebody to decrypt your secrets.
At the end the program will create a .txt file with decrypted information.


#P.S.

By the time of writing this program, I didn't know any GUI Frameworks, so I'm gonna correct this in a future and
make a GUI for the Text Encryptor.

Enjoy!
